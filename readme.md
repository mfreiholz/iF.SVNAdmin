iF.SVNAdmin
===========
The iF.SVNAdmin application is a web based GUI to your Subversion authorization 
file. It is based on PHP 5.3 and requires a web server (Apache) to be installed. 
The application doesnâ€™t need a database back end or anything similar, it 
completely based on the Subversion authorization- and user authentication file. 
(+Includes LDAP support for users and groups).

Now with direct Active Directory support (provider: ad) including nested groups.
This feature needs the adLDAP library.
