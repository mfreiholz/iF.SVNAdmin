The iF.SVNAdmin application is a web based GUI to your Subversion authorization 
file. It is based on PHP 5.3 and requires a web server (Apache) to be installed. 
The application doesnâ€™t need a database back end or anything similar, it 
completely based on the Subversion authorization- and user authentication file.

In case you feel happy with the application, got a lot of money to waste and don't know where to put it... you might consider to spend it on my Amazon wish list.
